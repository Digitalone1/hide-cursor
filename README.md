## Hide Cursor

### Install from the [GNOME Shell Extensions website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6727/hide-cursor/)

GNOME Shell extension to hide the cursor on inactivity.

For use on Wayland, since `unclutter`, `unclutter-xfixes` and `xbanish` only work on X11.

Works with GNOME Shell 48.

This is my personal fork without the Clutter unfocus inhibition because I don't need it.
