GNOME Shell extension to hide the cursor on inactivity

For use on Wayland, since `unclutter`, `unclutter-xfixes` and `xbanish` only work on X11.

*Thanks to Iago-lito `<iago-lito@etak>`, whose contribution corrected the timer behavior. Now the cursor hiding timer will start when the mouse is idle so that the cursor hides after the set timeout as originally intended.*

GNOME Shell 45 and later are supported.
