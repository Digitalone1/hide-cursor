GNOME Shell extension to hide the cursor on inactivity

For use on Wayland, since `unclutter`, `unclutter-xfixes` and `xbanish` only work on X11.

_**Note**: This initial version has a hardcoded 5 second timeout. I'd like to add settings to support configuring this value, but I have no definite plans. Collaboration appreciated! (I'd also accept a contribution adding support for hiding the cursor while typing, but I don't have plans for this myself.)_

Only GNOME Shell version 45 is supported.
